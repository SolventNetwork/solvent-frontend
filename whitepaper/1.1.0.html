<p>Existing decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols grapple with
vulnerabilities, especially during rapid market shifts that can render
loans insolvent before they can be liquidated. The Solvent Lending protocol
addresses this by using Interest Accruing Stop Loss Orders (IASLOs), a
new type of hook on top of Uniswap v4 liquidity pools. This mechanism
ensures that liquidations always happen when they are supposed to, even
during significant market fluctuations. This whitepaper presents
Solvent Lending’s design and compares its robustness to existing DeFi
lending systems, highlighting its potential to enhance stability and
decentralization in DeFi.</p>

<p id="whitepaper-version">Whitepaper version: </p>
</header>
<p>In the evolving DeFi ecosystem, decentralized finance has faced
notable vulnerabilities. One important issue is loans becoming insolvent
before liquidators can intervene, especially during sudden market
shifts. This not only places lending protocols at risk but also
diminishes trust in DeFi platforms. Solvent Lending proposes a
novel solution. This paper introduces a new DeFi primitive, the Interest
Accruing Stop Loss Order (IASLO), to be integrated with Uniswap v4
liquidity pools as a set of hooks. Using these IASLOs, Solvent Lending ensures
timely liquidations regardless of market conditions. This whitepaper details
the design of Solvent Lending, contrasting its strengths against
existing DeFi lending methods, and underscores its potential to bolster
stability, security, and decentralization in DeFi.</p>
<h1 data-number="1" id="background"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>DeFi lending protocols allow users to collateralize ERC-20 tokens,
leveraging them to borrow other tokens. At the heart of these systems is
a mechanism to manage the risk of volatile asset values. When collateral
asset values plummet, loans risk insolvency, leading to losses for the
protocol or its users.</p>
<p>Traditionally, these lending protocols have incorporated liquidators,
third-party participants who repay loans when the ratio between the
value of their borrowed tokens and their collateral falls such that they
become liquidatable. The liquidators receive a liquidation bonus, thus
taking over the collateral at a profit. The caveat here is that rapid
market shifts can outpace these liquidators, resulting in insolvent debt
on the lending protocol’s balance sheet. These insolvent loan positions
are backed by collateral assets that are worth too little to cover the
outstanding tokens lent out to borrowers. Ultimately this shortfall must
be covered by the protocol itself or by its users.</p>
<p>In practice, most liquidators are bots programmed to periodically
check for profitable liquidation opportunities. When they find one they
take out a flashloan,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> borrowing the borrowed token,
liquidating the lending position, swapping back to the borrowed token on
a decentralized exchange (DEX), and then repaying the flashloan. The
liquidator’s profit is the value of the liquidation bonus minus all
costs (gas fees, DEX swap fees, flashloan fee).</p>
<p>DEX liquidity is a crucial element in the liquidation process.
Liquidators cannot rely on centralized exchange (CEX) liquidity because
it cannot be incorporated into an atomic transaction.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> If
there’s any delay in swapping tokens, the liquidation cannot be financed
via flashloan. Liquidations without flashloans would require liquidator
bots to hold enough tokens to liquidate positions themselves, and
carrying a large enough balance for the largest and most profitable
liquidations would impose high capital costs and risk.</p>
<p>Despite DEX liquidity being so crucial, current lending protocols
cannot rely on it to exist when they need it. Liquidity providers can
withdraw the tokens necessary to liquidate all outstanding loans, and
the lending protocol has no smart-contract-enforced claim to those
funds.</p>
<p>Until now. With the advent of Uniswap v4 <span class="citation"
data-cites="adams2023"></span> and its “hooks,” there is an opportunity
to directly intervene in the contract execution process at specific
junctures, paving the way for more dynamic solutions to the liquidation
challenge.</p>
<p>In this backdrop, we introduce Solvent Lending, a DeFi lending
protocol that employs Uniswap v4 hooks. We introduce the Interest
Accruing Stop Loss Order (IASLO), a new hook type designed to guarantee
liquidations happen when relative token prices cross specific
thresholds.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="how-uniswap-v4-works"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> How Uniswap v4 works</h2>
<p>A quick background on Uniswap is required to understand Solvent
Lending. Uniswap is a DEX that allows users to swap different crypto
tokens according to the constant product formula, <span
class="math display"><em>x</em> × <em>y</em> = <em>k</em></span> where
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is the value of one token,
<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> is the value of the other
token, and <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> is a constant.
This means, for example, that if there are 10 times as many of token A
as there are of token B, then the price of B must be ten times A.</p>
<p>Users supply both tokens to the pool as liquidity, and the pool
contract accepts any incoming trade that pays the required price plus a
small fee. The fee rate differs between pools, but it’s most commonly
set to 0.3% of the trade value.</p>
<p>Uniswap v2 simply placed all liquidity into one big pool, evenly
spreading it between 0 and infinity. The innovation introduced in
Uniswap v3 was to allow users to concentrate their liquidity within
specific price ranges. This greatly improved the capital efficiency of
the exchange by concentrating liquidity where it was needed. For
instance, in pools for swapping two USD-pegged stablecoins, liquidity
concentrated between 0.99 and 1.01 is more useful, and accrues more
fees, than liquidity anywhere else in the range between 0 and infinity.
To allow for this, Uniswap v3 sliced up the price range from zero to
infinity into “ticks” of uniform size. Liquidity providers can specify a
range of ticks to add tokens to, with the tokens in a tick offering
concentrated liquidity within the tick’s narrow price range.</p>
<p>The most significant change from Uniswap v3 to Uniswap v4 is the
addition of “hooks” which are calls to external smart contracts that
happen before or after users take specific actions: initializing a pool,
modifying a liquidity position, swapping tokens, or donating tokens.
These hooks are necessary for Solvent Lending to function.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="solvent-lending-an-overview"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Solvent Lending: An
Overview</h1>
<p>Solvent Lending has two parts: IASLOs implemented as Uniswap v4
hooks, and the lending protocol itself, which relies on the IASLOs for
liquidations.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1"
id="interest-accruing-stop-loss-orders-iaslos"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Interest Accruing Stop-Loss
Orders (IASLOs)</h2>
<p>A stop-loss order is an order to sell an asset when its price falls
to a certain value. It is the mirror image of a limit order, an order to
buy (sell) an asset when it falls below (rises above) some price. But
while stop losses and limit orders are superficially similar, there are
important differences that make stop losses more difficult to
implement.</p>
<p>Limit orders buy when traders are selling and sell when traders are
buying. The trades that move prices to the limit price can also be used
to fill the orders. They provide additional liquidity for the traders
willing to take the other side of the order.</p>
<p>Stop losses sell when traders are selling and buy when traders are
buying. This means that they compete with traders for liquidity. This
imposes a constraint on stop losses: the liquidity pool must have
sufficient liquidity to fill all stop-loss orders alongside the trades
that trigger them. This means that some liquidity must be locked up to
fulfill stop-loss orders. This lockup is an implicit cost on liquidity
providers, who must be compensated with interest payments.</p>
<p>An IASLO is a stop-loss order that accrues interest to be paid to
liquidity providers (and possibly other parties). As it accrues
interest, its debt increases while its collateral balance remains
constant, causing it to slide along the price curve into different price
ticks. Every tick must always have enough liquidity to fill all
stop-loss orders in the tick’s price range, and these orders must be
automatically triggered by any swap that moves the price past the
stop-loss order’s current price.</p>
<p>One thing worth noting is that IASLOs have utility outside of the
context of Solvent Lending, and nothing prevents any user or
smart contract from using them once deployed. The simplest use case is for
traders to prevent excessive losses on their assets.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.1.1" id="the-iaslo-smart-contract"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> The IASLO Smart Contract</h3>
<p>The IASLO smart contract features a ledger with all outstanding
stop-loss orders, and their associated ticks and interest rates. It
features the following functions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>open_new_stop_loss()</code> allows the user to open a new
stop-loss order if there is sufficient liquidity in the relevant price
tick.</p></li>
<li><p><code>change_external_interest()</code> allows the user to change
the additional interest accrued by the position. IASLOs pay interest to
liquidity providers, and they can optionally pay additional interest to
a third party (e.g. a lending pool).</p></li>
<li><p><code>close_stop_loss()</code> allows the user to repay the
outstanding interest on an open stop-loss order and close the order or
collect the exchanged tokens if the stop loss has been
executed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>repay_interest()</code> allows the user to repay all or a
portion of interest without closing the order.</p></li>
<li><p><code>realize_interest()</code> moves an order to a new price
tick if sufficient interest has accrued and the new tick has sufficient
liquidity.</p></li>
<li><p><code>disburse_interest()</code> calls the <code>donate()</code>
function of the Uniswap v4 pool to pay accrued interest owed to
liquidity providers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The IASLO contract’s base interest rate is a variable rate based on
the ratio of stop-loss orders in a tick and the amount of liquidity in
that tick. If a high fraction of total liquidity is tied up in stop loss
orders, the interest rate may be very high, encouraging users to add
additional liquidity to cover all orders and allow other users to make
withdrawals.</p>
<p>When initializing an IASLO-enabled liquidity pool, it must be
connected to the IASLO smart contract via two hooks:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Before a swap transaction is executed, a hook calls the IASLO
smart contract. This hook checks if the swap has moved the price through
one or more new price ticks. If there are stop-loss orders associated
with those ticks, they are added to the swap and executed as a batch
alongside it.</p></li>
<li><p>Before a user modifies their liquidity position, a hook calls the
IASLO smart contract and checks if this change would reduce liquidity
below the amount needed to fulfil all stop loss orders in all
ticks.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 data-number="3" id="solvent-lending-technical-specifications"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Solvent Lending Technical
Specifications</h1>
<p>Solvent Lending allows users to deposit tokens as collateral and
borrow other tokens, deposited by other users, against them. It features
the following functions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>add_token_pair()</code> creates a new lending pool linked
to an IASLO-enabled Uniswap v4 pool. When creating the pair, the user
sets fixed parameters, such as the interest rate curve.</p></li>
<li><p><code>deposit()</code> allows users to deposit ERC-20 tokens as
collateral into specific token pairs. Depositors earn interest on their
tokens when they are borrowed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>withdraw()</code> enables depositors to withdraw their
tokens. This function checks if there is sufficient liquidity in the
protocol to fulfill the withdrawal without affecting outstanding loans.
If not, the request will be queued until liquidity is
available.</p></li>
<li><p><code>borrow()</code> lets users open a borrow position with
their collateral tokens. The collateral is deposited into an IASLO at
the price ratio that would make its value equal to that of the borrowed
tokens.</p></li>
<li><p><code>repay_loan()</code> allows borrowers to repay their
borrowed amount plus any accumulated interest. Repayments can be partial
or full.</p></li>
<li><p><code>liquidate_borrow()</code> resolves a liquidation after it
has been triggered by the IASLO contract, marking the position as
closed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>collect_interest()</code> takes any interest accrued from
borrowers and distributes it to token depositors, rewarding them for
providing liquidity.</p></li>
<li><p><code>update_interest_rate()</code> adjusts the interest rate of
a token pair and passes it to the IASLO contract. The interest rate is
an increasing function of the ratio of tokens available to lend and
tokens borrowed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>update_protocol_fee()</code> adjusts the fraction of
interest accruing to the protocol. This action can only be performed by
the protocol owner. The default fee rate is 0%.</p></li>
<li><p><code>set_protocol_fee_recipient()</code> changes the address
protocol fees are sent to. This action can only be performed by the
protocol owner.</p></li>
<li><p><code>collect_protocol_fees()</code> sends accumulated protocol
fees for a specific pool to the protocol fee recipient.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The interest rate curve is an increasing function of the ratio of
tokens available to lend and tokens borrowed. In contrast to other
lending protocols, tokens used as collateral cannot be lent out, as they
are locked into the IASLO contract. Tokens being used as collateral do
not accrue interest.</p>

id="detailed-walkthrough-of-a-typical-borrower"><span

Typical Borrower</h2>
<p>Alice wants to borrow USDC using ETH as collateral.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.1.0.1" id="initialization"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.0.1</span> Initialization</h4>
<p>Alice first chooses a token pair, in this case, ETH-USDC. The pair is
associated with an IASLO-enabled Uniswap v4 pool.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.1.0.2" id="deposit"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.0.2</span> Deposit</h4>
<p>Alice deposits 10 ETH using the <code>deposit()</code> function. This
ETH will serve as her collateral.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.1.0.3" id="borrowing"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.0.3</span> Borrowing</h4>
<p>After depositing her ETH, Alice uses the <code>borrow()</code>
function to take out a loan of USDC. There is effectively no limit on
how leveraged Alice can get. In the extreme case, she can borrow almost
the total value of her ETH in USDC, with her liquidation price one tick
below the current price tick. Alice chooses a leverage position based on
her personal risk appetite.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.1.0.4" id="interest-accumulation"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.0.4</span> Interest Accumulation</h4>
<p>As time progresses, the interest on the borrowed USDC accumulates.
Some of the interest accrues to liquidity providers in the Uniswap v4
pool via the IASLO smart contract. The other portion of interest accrues
to users who provide the USDC tokens in a Solvent Lending
pool. This interest rate adjusts dynamically based on the demand for
borrowing, and the available supply of USDC in the pool, periodically
passed to the IASLO contract by the <code>update_interest_rate()</code>
function. Sometimes, enough interest accrues that Alice’s position needs
to move up a tick. When any user calls the
<code>realize_interest()</code> function, Alice’s borrow position is
moved to the new tick if the new tick has sufficient liquidity to fill
the stop loss order.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h4 data-number="4.1.0.5" id="repayment"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.0.5</span> Repayment</h4>
<p>After some time, Alice decides to repay her loan. She returns the

<code>repay_loan()</code> function.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.1.0.6" id="withdrawal"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.0.6</span> Withdrawal</h4>
<p>After repaying her loan, Alice can use the <code>withdraw()</code>
function to reclaim her 10 ETH, or she might leave it in the pool to
accumulate interest when borrowed by other users.</p>

class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Analysis of a Worst-Case
Scenario: Collateral Token Exploit</h2>
<p>Imagine a token called VUL (Vulnerable Token) with an unknown
vulnerability.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.2.0.1" id="deposit-and-borrow"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2.0.1</span> Deposit and Borrow</h4>
<p>Alice deposits ETH in the Solvent Lending ETH/VUL pool. Bob deposits
a significant amount of VUL and borrows ETH.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.2.0.2" id="exploit"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2.0.2</span> Exploit</h4>
<p>Chris, a hacker, discovers a way to mint unlimited VUL tokens. He
sets up a series of transactions to extract the maximum possible value
from this exploit. VUL’s price starts plummeting rapidly as Chris drains
all available liquidity. Chris sells as much VUL as possible in the
Uniswap v4 VUL/ETH pool. Chris’s sale moves the VUL/ETH price through
the tick where Bob’s VUL becomes liquidatable.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.2.0.3" id="iaslo-trigger"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2.0.3</span> IASLO Trigger</h4>
<p>Chris’s transaction in Uniswap v4 triggers the hook that calls the
IASLO contract. Since the price is passing through Bob’s liquidation
price tick, a VUL <span class="math inline">→</span> ETH swap is added
to Chris’s transaction for the amount of ETH Bob owes. These ETH tokens
are set aside to be collected by the Solvent Lending contract.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.2.0.4" id="liquidation"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2.0.4</span> Liquidation</h4>
<p>Any user can call Solvent Lending’s <code>liquidate_borrow()</code>
function on Bob’s borrow position. This returns the liquidated ETH to
the pool and marks Bob’s position as closed. Alice can withdraw the ETH
she contributed to the pool plus interest since Bob’s position was
safely liquidated.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.2.0.5" id="outcome"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2.0.5</span> Outcome</h4>
<p>In traditional DeFi platforms, there’s a range of prices between the
price that makes a borrow position liquidatable and the price that makes
it insolvent and unable to be liquidated profitably. The price must stay
in this range long enough for liquidators to repay the loans. If prices
fall through this range very quickly, as they do in the case of an
exploit, it may not be possible for liquidators to liquidate all debt
positions, leaving the protocol with insolvent debts. With Solvent
Lending’s integration of IASLO, the system is able to liquidate all
borrow positions in the same transactions that cause prices to fall,
ensuring the protocol remains solvent.</p>
<h1 data-number="5"
id="comparative-analysis-of-solvent-lending-vs-existing-lending-protocols"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Comparative Analysis of Solvent
Lending vs Existing Lending Protocols</h1>
<p>Solvent Lending works in a substantially different way from existing
protocols, so it has both advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.0.0.1" id="permissionless-and-self-serve"><span
class="header-section-number">5.0.0.1</span> Permissionless and
Self-Serve</h4>
<p>As we saw in the exploited token example above, Solvent Lending does
not take losses when a bad token is added as collateral. Because of
this, any token pair can be added to the protocol by a user without the
need for permission or a governance vote. A token can be launched and
have an on-chain lending market on the same day.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.0.0.2" id="collateral-factor-of-100"><span
class="header-section-number">5.0.0.2</span> Collateral Factor of
100%</h4>
<p>Solvent Lending allows users to borrow such that they would be
liquidated at any price tick below the current one, so long as there
exists sufficient liquidity in the tick to liquidate all positions.
Existing lending protocols must limit borrowing to a fraction of
collateral value to give liquidators a window of prices in which to
liquidate. Solvent Lending's IASLO-based liquidation mechanism does
not require this.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.0.0.3" id="governance-free"><span
class="header-section-number">5.0.0.3</span> Governance Free</h4>
<p>The IASLO and Solvent Lending contracts are non-upgradeable. All the
parameters for a lending pool are set when it is initialized and cannot
be changed.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.0.0.4" id="oracle-free"><span
class="header-section-number">5.0.0.4</span> Oracle Free</h4>
<p>Solvent Lending relies only on the token balances of the
underlying IASLO-enabled Uniswap v4 pools for liquidations. It does not
require any price oracles, on-chain or off-chain.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.0.0.5" id="no-liquidator-fees"><span
class="header-section-number">5.0.0.5</span> No Liquidator Fees</h4>
<p>Solvent Lending uses IASLO hooks to automatically liquidate debt
positions when trades cause prices to move. Traders have a natural
incentive to arbitrage away price differences between different
exchanges, so they don’t need an additional bonus to incentivize them to
make trades that trigger liquidations.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h4 data-number="5.0.0.6" id="no-lending-of-collateral"><span
class="header-section-number">5.0.0.6</span> No Lending of
Collateral</h4>
<p>In existing protocols, a user’s collateral tokens go into a big pool
and a fraction of them are lent out to other users. IASLOs require the
collateral tokens to be locked in the IASLO contract, so they cannot
contribute to the pool of loanable tokens. A user who wants to earn
interest on his tokens in Solvent Lending cannot simultaneously use
them as collateral.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.0.0.7"
id="one-collateral-token-one-borrowed-token"><span
class="header-section-number">5.0.0.7</span> One Collateral Token, One
Borrowed Token</h4>
<p>In existing protocols, a user can use one or more collateral tokens
to borrow one or more other tokens. Solvent Lending only allows for
one-to-one borrowing. A user may have many borrow positions, but each
one has a separate liquidation price associated with a specific Uniswap
v4 pool.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>The project of DeFi is to create robust and decentralized systems
allowing anyone access to finance without permission or gatekeepers. But
while users can trade tokens permissionlessly, the current generation of
lending protocols are simply too risky to allow permissionless lending
and borrowing. They require active risk management to avoid catastrophic
losses.</p>
<p>Solvent Lending is the first permissionless lending market for
DeFi. It achieves this by having a liquidation mechanism that is robust
to any price change of the underlying tokens. It has no external
dependencies: no governance, no price oracles. Once deployed on-chain,
it can conceivably function for as long as the underlying chain
continues to operate. This is not just a step, but a leap forward for
DeFi, presenting a paradigm where trust is in the code and resilience is
inherent. Solvent Lending epitomizes the true spirit of DeFi,
marrying security with absolute decentralization. The future of lending
in DeFi might just be solvent by default.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>A flashloan is a special type of uncollateralized loan
that is only possible in DeFi. A user can take out a loan of any size so
long as they pay back the loan plus a fee by the end of the transaction.
If the user does not pay off the loan, the entire transaction simply
fails, and the loan never occurs.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>The two types of crypto exchanges are DEXs and CEXs. A
DEX is a set of smart contracts that allow users to trade entirely
on-chain. Users supply tokens to DEX pools and other users trade against
these pools, paying trading fees to the liquidity providers. CEXs are
run by centralized entities that effectively function as crypto banks.
The CEX keeps a database of user balances, and all trades within the CEX
happen off-chain in that database.<a href="#fnref2"
